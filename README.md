### üëã Hi there! I'm Janice

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) at Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TARUMT). I'm a passionate coder with a deep love for building innovative software solutions that make a difference. I thrive on diving into collaborative projects and enjoy every opportunity to sharpen my programming skills, whether it's creating something from scratch, optimizing existing systems, or exploring the latest technologies.

### üöÄ What I'm Working On

**SMSecure: An Advanced SMS Spam Filtering System**
SMSecure is a secure solution designed to tackle the growing problem of spam messages, which often include phishing scams, fraudulent schemes, and unwanted promotions that can lead to financial losses and compromised personal information. Developed with a focus on privacy and security, SMSecure uses machine learning techniques to intelligently detect and filter out spam messages, ensuring that only legitimate messages reach the user.

**üîç Key Features of SMSecure:**
**Machine Learning-Based Filtering:** Leverages multiple machine learning algorithms, including BiLSTM, Linear SVM, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages. The system is trained on a comprehensive dataset to assess message content, detect patterns, and analyze sender behavior.

**Real-Time Detection:** SMSecure processes incoming messages in real-time, swiftly identifying and blocking spam messages before they reach the user's inbox. This proactive approach minimizes the risk of exposure to potential scams or unwanted content.

**Customizable Filtering Rules:** Allows users to define personalized filtering rules, giving them control over what types of messages they consider spam. This feature ensures the system adapts to individual preferences and needs.

**Continuous Learning and Improvement:** Incorporates feedback mechanisms where users can mark messages as spam or not spam, allowing the machine learning model to learn from these inputs and continuously improve its accuracy over time.

**Detailed Analytics and Reporting:** Provides users with insights into their message history, including the number of spam messages blocked, types of detected spam, and detailed analytics on potential threats, enhancing awareness and understanding of spam trends.

**üåê Why SMSecure?**
Spam messages are more than just an annoyance, they pose significant privacy and security risks. SMSecure addresses these challenges by offering a reliable, user-friendly solution that filters out spam without compromising user privacy. It aims to provide peace of mind by ensuring a safer messaging experience, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to scams and unwanted communications.

### üå± I‚Äôm Always Learning

I believe that technology is ever-evolving, and to stay ahead, one must always keep learning. I'm currently deepening my knowledge in:

- **Machine Learning and AI:** Exploring advanced algorithms and models to develop smarter and more efficient applications.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enhancing my understanding of NLP to build applications that can interact more naturally with users.
- **Design Thinking:** Exploring user-centered design principles to create software that truly meets users' needs and expectations.
- **Full-Stack Application Development:** Developing end-to-end applications using Flutter for the front-end to and Firebase Firestore as the back-end.
